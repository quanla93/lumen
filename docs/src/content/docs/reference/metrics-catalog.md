This page is the contract between the agent and everything that
consumes its data (hub, UI, future Prometheus exporter). When a
field's meaning is ambiguous, this page is the tie-breaker.

Two columns of "lives here":

| Column | Means |
|---|---|
| **Persisted** | Stored in the `snapshots` SQLite table, queryable via `GET /api/hosts/{id}/metrics`. |
| **Live-only** | Flows through `/api/stream` only. Lost on hub restart; the agent's next tick repopulates. |

## Core host metrics

All persisted. Reported every `LUMEN_AGENT_INTERVAL` (default 5 s).

### `cpu_pct` — aggregate CPU utilization

| | |
|---|---|
| **Source** | gopsutil `cpu.PercentWithContext(500ms, false)` |
| **Unit** | percent (0–100) |
| **Sample window** | 500 ms blocking sample at collection time |
| **Persisted** | yes |

Mirrors what `top` shows at the bottom — total CPU usage averaged
across all cores. A 4-core box pegged on one core reports `cpu_pct ≈
25`, not 100. Use `cpu_per_core` to see imbalance.

The 500 ms window is the smallest useful one — shorter and the
delta is too noisy; longer and the agent's own tick budget tightens.

### `cpu_per_core` — per-core CPU utilization

| | |
|---|---|
| **Source** | gopsutil `cpu.PercentWithContext(200ms, true)` |
| **Unit** | percent (0–100), one entry per logical CPU |
| **Cardinality** | matches `runtime.NumCPU()` on the agent host |
| **Persisted** | **no — live-only** |

The host detail page renders this as a per-core strip with 4 density
tiers (≤8 cores → individual bars, ≤16 → compressed, ≤32 → mini, >32
→ heatmap row). Cap is 256 cores per envelope at the hub validator.

Not stored because cardinality varies per host and over time
(hyperthread on/off, container CPU sets), and the analytical value
of per-core history pre-v1 is modest. Phase 5 may add a separate
table behind a feature flag.

### `ram_pct`, `swap_pct` — memory pressure

| | |
|---|---|
| **Source** | gopsutil `mem.VirtualMemoryWithContext` + `mem.SwapMemoryWithContext` |
| **Unit** | percent (0–100) |
| **Persisted** | yes |

`ram_pct` is `(total - available) / total * 100` — matches `free`'s
"used" excluding page cache. Means a Linux box with full page cache
reports a sane number, not 99%.

`swap_pct` is `used / total * 100`. A host with no swap configured
reports `0`. Sudden non-zero swap with steady ram_pct is the classic
"investigate, you might be near OOM" signal.

### `disk_pct` — filesystem fullness

| | |
|---|---|
| **Source** | gopsutil `disk.UsageWithContext(LUMEN_AGENT_DISK_PATH)` |
| **Unit** | percent (0–100) |
| **Path** | `LUMEN_AGENT_DISK_PATH`, defaults to `/` on Linux/macOS, `C:\` on Windows |
| **Persisted** | yes |

Only one filesystem per host. If you care about a non-root mount
(e.g. `/data`), set `LUMEN_AGENT_DISK_PATH=/data` in the agent env
or run a second agent with `LUMEN_AGENT_HOST=$host-data`. Phase 3
may add a per-mount-point list; the single-path field stays as the
"primary" disk forever.

### `load1`, `load5`, `load15` — load average

| | |
|---|---|
| **Source** | gopsutil `load.AvgWithContext` |
| **Unit** | runnable+uninterruptible processes (kernel-defined) |
| **Persisted** | yes |
| **Platform** | Linux + macOS only; Windows kernel doesn't expose this |

On Windows the agent logs Debug "load sample unavailable" and ships
zeros. The UI hides the load chart if all three are 0 across the
query window.

Interpretation: a 4-core machine with `load1 = 4.0` is at exactly
the saturation line. Above that, work is queuing.

## Rate metrics

All four are diffed from cumulative gopsutil counters across two
ticks. On the very first tick after agent start there's no prior
value — those fields are 0. On a counter wrap or reset (interface
flap, disk hot-swap) the next sample is also 0 rather than a
garbage huge value.

### `net_rx_bps`, `net_tx_bps` — network throughput

| | |
|---|---|
| **Source** | gopsutil `net.IOCountersWithContext(false)` summed across all interfaces |
| **Unit** | bytes per second |
| **Persisted** | yes |

Summed across every interface (loopback included — usually
negligible). The UI shows these as kB/s or MB/s depending on
magnitude.

### `disk_r_bps`, `disk_w_bps` — disk I/O throughput

| | |
|---|---|
| **Source** | gopsutil `disk.IOCountersWithContext()` summed across all devices |
| **Unit** | bytes per second |
| **Persisted** | yes |

Sum across all block devices reported by the kernel — physical
disks, partitions, dm devices, loop devices. May be higher than the
filesystem-visible write rate if dm/LVM is in the chain (double
counting).

## Optional metrics

### `temp_c` — hottest sensor temperature

| | |
|---|---|
| **Source** | gopsutil `host.SensorsTemperaturesWithContext`, prefers `coretemp` / `k10temp` |
| **Unit** | degrees Celsius |
| **Persisted** | yes |
| **Platform** | Linux only (reads `/sys/class/hwmon`); 0 elsewhere |

The agent picks the highest reading among `coretemp_*` and
`k10temp_*` sensors. Other sensor names are ignored to avoid e.g. a
disk SMART temperature dominating the chart.

In containers/LXC the `/sys/class/hwmon` path may not be exposed —
the value is 0 and the UI hides the temperature chart entirely.
Privileged LXC can bind-mount the path:

```
lxc.mount.entry: /sys/class/hwmon sys/class/hwmon none bind,optional,ro 0 0
```

### `containers` — Docker container snapshot

| | |
|---|---|
| **Source** | minimal HTTP client over `/var/run/docker.sock`, paths `/containers/json` + `/containers/{id}/stats?stream=false` |
| **Persisted** | **no — live-only** |
| **Platform** | Anywhere with a Docker socket reachable |
| **Cap** | 500 entries per envelope (hub-side validator) |

One row per running OR recently-exited container (Docker's "all"
filter, so a `state=exited` container shows once before the daemon
prunes it). Fields:

```ts
{
  id: string;            // short 12-char ID
  name: string;          // leading "/" stripped (Docker quirk)
  image: string;
  state: string;         // running | paused | exited | restarting | dead
  cpu_pct: number;       // delta math, matches `docker stats`
  mem_used_bytes: number;
  mem_limit_bytes: number;
  mem_pct: number;
}
```

The CPU% formula matches Docker stats exactly:

```
cpu_pct = (cpu_total_delta / system_total_delta) * online_cpus * 100
```

Memory is `usage - inactive_file` (subtracts page cache so a
container doing big sequential reads doesn't look full).

If the socket is missing: silent. If present but unreadable
(permissions): one Warn line at agent startup, then Debug — the
agent doesn't spam the log.

## System metadata

Agents also send system metadata with each ingest. The hub stores the
latest values on the host record, not in each historical snapshot row.
The dashboard uses these fields for the host detail header and future
version-awareness UI.

| Field | Source | Persisted |
|---|---|---|
| `system.os` | gopsutil host info | host record |
| `system.hostname` | OS hostname | host record |
| `system.primary_ip` | first non-loopback private/global IP | host record |
| `system.kernel` | gopsutil host info | host record |
| `system.arch` | runtime architecture | host record |
| `system.cpu_model` | CPU info | host record |
| `system.uptime_seconds` | gopsutil host info | host record |
| `system.agent_version` | agent build metadata | host record |

`agent_version` records what the agent reports today. Comparing it to a
hub-known latest version is planned for the agent lifecycle UI, but is
not implemented yet.

## Hub-side derived fields

The hub adds fields to each `HostSnapshot` it broadcasts that the agent
doesn't send:

| Field | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `cpu_series` | Last ~120 CPU% samples (oldest first). Lets the dashboard render a sparkline on first paint without waiting for the next tick. |
| `last_seen_at` (in `/api/hosts`) | When the hub last accepted an ingest from this host. Drives the gray "stale" badge in the UI. |

Both are computed in-memory; neither survives a hub restart, but
both repopulate within one tick of agent activity.

## Wire envelope summary

What an agent POSTs to `/api/ingest`:

| Field | Persisted | Live-only | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `host` | n/a — overwritten | n/a | Token's host name wins |
| `ts` | yes | — | RFC3339; UTC; nanoseconds OK |
| `cpu_pct` | yes | — | |
| `cpu_per_core` | — | yes | Variable cardinality |
| `ram_pct`, `swap_pct` | yes | — | |
| `disk_pct` | yes | — | One path |
| `load1`, `load5`, `load15` | yes | — | Windows = 0 |
| `net_rx_bps`, `net_tx_bps` | yes | — | All interfaces summed |
| `disk_r_bps`, `disk_w_bps` | yes | — | All block devices summed |
| `temp_c` | yes | — | 0 if no sensor |
| `containers[]` | — | yes | Cap 500 |
| `system` | host record | latest value in WS | Host metadata, not stored per history point |

## Field stability

These names + units are the v0 contract. They won't change pre-1.0
without a deprecation note in the release announcement. New fields
are added as optional / zero-defaulted — older agents stay
compatible.
